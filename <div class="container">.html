      Saudi National Day is one of the most celebrated occasions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as it honors Saudi history and achievements.  
      At TKS, Saudi National Day is an inquiry into the history, culture, tradition, and future of Saudi Arabia. 
      Students will engage with stories from the past and be asked to consider the possibilities of vision 2030
       and how Saudi Arabia can contribute to a sustainable world. 
      During the week of September 18, we will be engaging students in different activities that represent Saudi culture
       and traditions, with our main celebration on Tuesday, September 20. </p>
